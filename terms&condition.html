          <h3>Return Policy</h3> <br>

            Since we only manufacture what is ordered, The Main Label does not accept returns or exchanges at this time. 
	
All instant purchases should be discussed directly with the seller you purchased from as they are responsible for their own shop policies.

If you are unhappy with your order for any reason at all, please contact The Main Label at <a href="email">customerservice@themainlabel.com</a> and we’ll work with you to make it right.

We will not accept any packages sent without authorization, any shipments received that have not been authorized will be refused/shipped back.

          <h3>Cancellations </h3> <br>
          <p>
            If you decide that you no longer want your order for any reason you may cancel it as long as the campaign period is still active. However, once a campaign ends, we are unable to cancel an order as the information has already been sent to the printer for manufacturing and fulfillment. 
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Colors</h3> <br>
          <p>

However, as the actual colors you see will depend on your monitor and/or other technological circumstance, we cannot and do not guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will be accurate.
          </p>
          <hr>
